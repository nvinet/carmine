team.member.anais.fullName=Anaïs Lombard
team.member.anais.title=Director of Marketing/Business Development
team.member.anais.twitter=@anaisinjapan
team.member.anais.lastBeautyProductPurchased=I rarely buy beauty products. I usually nicely ask my friends from the beauty industry to make me their guinea pig and give me samples. It’s like having a personal Carmine service. I get to try new things all the time. Right Now I’m experimenting with Nars new Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner. It’s serious long-wear because it lasts longer than the time I spend in the office!
team.member.anais.bestFeature=My back. I think it’s a nice back - or maybe it’s just because I can only get a glimpse of it!
team.member.anais.weirdBeautyExperience=I was getting spray tanned for the first time in New York when the 2003 blackout happened. Half of my body was already sprayed and after waiting for a while, we realized that the power was not coming back. I had to scrub furiously to stop the action of the self-tanner so I wouldn’t look ridiculous.
team.member.anais.productDyingToTry=Eyelash extensions.
team.member.anais.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Take the time to actually listen.
team.member.anais.famousLookalike=My sweet grandmother thinks I look like a cheesy 90s French soap opera actress, Vanessa Demouy. And someone told me I look like Blake Lively, but I think it’s just when I have my hair in my face.
team.member.anais.famousLookToSteal=
team.member.anais.howEndedUpHere=I was minding my own business, watching bad American shows on my couch, when Michiel (that’s the big boss) contacted me. I thought the project was so great I decided to come out of my early retirement. I managed to produce a 50-page memo on why I should be hired. Before Carmine, I worked for ELLEgirl magazine in New York, Shiseido in Tokyo and Soap & Glory in London.

team.member.clement.fullName=Clément Mazen
team.member.clement.title=In charge of customer acquisition
team.member.clement.twitter=@clement_m
team.member.clement.lastBeautyProductPurchased=Biotherm Homme Aquapower Moisturizer.
team.member.clement.bestFeature=My hair. If genes can be trusted, it’s here to stay. And even though there is the odd white hair, it still is mostly robust and coloured the way it’s always been.
team.member.clement.weirdBeautyExperience=Being very careful before a long drive across the Death Valley in a convertible car, I applied vast amounts of Max-Index sun-cream on every inch of skin I could think of. This worked perfectly well – except somehow I forgot that ears are covered in skin, too. It goes without saying: they roasted.
team.member.clement.productDyingToTry=Permanent face-shaving, which would save lots of time!
team.member.clement.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=If done correctly, “Blue Steel” (from Zoolander)
team.member.clement.famousLookalike=Harry Potter
team.member.clement.famousLookToSteal=“Magnum” - also from the movie Zoolander. With much training over the years, I have managed to reliably produce a decent “Blue Steel”, but the “Magnum” still is hit and miss. So if I could steal it, I would not hesitate.
team.member.clement.howEndedUpHere=After working in two of the most un-glamorous industries (used cars & home improvement/maintenance) my girlfriend insisted on me finding a job in a sector she’s not ashamed of to tell her friends about. So I did, and she actually really likes the website and the box!

team.member.dan.lastBeautyProductPurchased=Johnsons wet wipes and Batiste dry shampoo - In a vain effort to maintain some level of presentability during 5 days without a shower at Glastonbury.
team.member.dan.bestFeature=My beard. 1) All the best nerds have beards - fact!  2) Beards win hands down when it comes to the effort and pain of shaving.
team.member.dan.weirdBeautyExperience=It was far from beautiful, but I once wrote 'Dan' across my stomach in SPF 50 before laying out in the sun for a couple of hours.  Turns out, SPF 50's pretty effective...  I was stuck with that all summer which made for some interesting beach trips.
team.member.dan.productDyingToTry=I've wanted to get a tattoo for a while.  Is that beauty related? It'll do.
team.member.dan.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Not break the build.
team.member.dan.famousLookalike=Caleb Followill (Kings of Leon). Though as far as I can tell, all we have in common is beards.
team.member.dan.famousLookToSteal=Nick Valensi (The Strokes)
team.member.dan.howEndedUpHere=I interviewed with Nic at his previous place, and despite his relentless begging and pleading I decided to decline his job offer and stay where I was.  Fast forward about a year and just when I thought I was going to have to take out a restraining order, Nic produced the goods: A green field development role, working with awesome tech in the beauty industry!  The stuff dreams are made of - how could I refuse?

team.member.emma.bestFeature=My eyebrows. Strange, I know, but when I was young I hated them. Now that big brows are in I’m loving them again!
team.member.emma.weirdBeautyExperience=I once went for acupuncture and cupping as well as an intense massage. It was one of the strangest experiences but weirdly relaxing!
team.member.emma.productDyingToTry=I’m seriously dying to have a Wah manicure! I want my nails all the colours of the rainbow!
team.member.emma.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Dream
team.member.emma.famousLookalike=Ann Hathaway…. I don’t see it personally
team.member.emma.famousLookToSteal=Fern Cotton, I wish I was that effortlessly cool
team.member.emma.howEndedUpHere=I had just graduated studying Fashion Media at Uni and was searching for a job in PR and Marketing. I looked for what seemed like forever for the perfect job (which can get a little depressing), finally I was put in contact with Anais through a friend and the rest is history as they say!

team.member.florentine.lastBeautyProductPurchased=The Dior Addict lipstick as advertised by Kate Moss... in the same shade... without even trying it on!  I so want to be like her!!! Fun.
team.member.florentine.bestFeature=My hands. Long and slim fingers. All my fingers have the same ring-size, both hand including thumbs and pinkies.
team.member.florentine.weirdBeautyExperience=After total recovery from cancer and chemotherapy my hair grew back dark and CURLY!! Before is was blond and straight.  I always wanted curls, but 'be careful what you which for', now I have no clue what to do with this hair.
team.member.florentine.productDyingToTry=A bikini-line lazer treatment that works! Have tried several but the hairs are still there..hmmm $*%!

team.member.jenni.fullName=Jenni Retourne
team.member.jenni.title=Blogger Relations Manager
team.member.jenni.twitter=
team.member.jenni.lastBeautyProductPurchased=Illamasqua Precision Ink in Havoc – an amazing aubergine-coloured eyeliner that doesn’t budge all day. It takes a lot for a beauty product to impress me and this had me reaching for my purse in seconds.
team.member.jenni.bestFeature=My brown eyes – the amount of different looks you can create using the eyes as the focus is a constant source of joy.
team.member.jenni.weirdBeautyExperience=I once had my skin computer-analyzed by Imedeen to assess how environmental damage such as sun, pollution, etc will affect my skin in the future. Amazingly the woman said my skin showed the best results she had ever seen, which means I can (hopefully) expect smooth, wrinkle-free skin in the future. The moral of the story is – don’t smoke and stay out of the sun ladies, and enjoy youthful-looking skin for decades to come!
team.member.jenni.productDyingToTry=I need to get my hands on a BB (Blemish Balm) Cream – the latest UK craze that has long been hugely popular in Asia. BB Creams are a skincare/make up hybrid that provides skincare, healing, coverage and protection. Seriously, what’s not to love?
team.member.jenni.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=To be kind, trustworthy and respectful – it’s what will bring you amazing friendships and relationships and if you have this in life then everything else is easy.
team.member.jenni.famousLookalike=Does Betty Boop count?!
team.member.jenni.famousLookToSteal=Liv Tyler, all day long; what a strikingly beautiful, classy lady.
team.member.jenni.howEndedUpHere=Talk about fate; I came across Carmine’s mysterious website holding page that said something along the lines of ‘watch this space for something truly exciting and different’, with an email address listed. On a whim, I sent an email saying ‘Love your mysterious website - I have no idea what you are working on but I specialize in social media for the beauty industry, so give me a shout if I can be of any help!’ By sheer coincidence Carmine had agencies pitching for their social media work that week so I got my skates on and dashed down to London to dazzle them… the rest, as they say, is history!

team.member.lauren.lastBeautyProductPurchased=The Topshop mascara in Carbon, which I am very impressed by!
team.member.lauren.bestFeature=My eyes, they are meant to be the window to your soul after all and it's the area I can experiment with most when doing my makeup.
team.member.lauren.weirdBeautyExperience=I have a 'cows lick' in my hair and have tried various methods to try to get rid of it (including sellotaping it down overnight), none of which have been successful.
team.member.lauren.productDyingToTry=Having my eyelashes curled and tinted so that I wouldn't have to apply so much mascara!
team.member.lauren.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Make someone else feel beautiful.
team.member.lauren.famousLookalike=Lauren Conrad - I think it's the name more than the face to be honest!
team.member.lauren.famousLookToSteal=Jessica Alba because I have never seen a bad picture of her.
team.member.lauren.howEndedUpHere=After carrying out a few internships in consumer PR agencies I decided I wanted to try and find a job that involved something I was passionate about - the beauty industry! Once I heard about Carmine and their beauty box, I was very excited at the prospect of being part of an innovative and growing company and I couldn't wait to get on board :)

team.member.michiel.lastBeautyProductPurchased=Sebastian Dry Conditioner for my son who HATES getting his hair wet
team.member.michiel.bestFeature=My eyes. I first knew that I was a metro man when I succumbed to eye cream.
team.member.michiel.weirdBeautyExperience=On Sunday mornings I get woken up by my two year old son who loves nothing better than putting lipstick all over his face. Oh, and I also tried that silly fish pedicure thing and it is weird indeed!
team.member.michiel.productDyingToTry=Dye my hair wild colours.
team.member.michiel.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Laugh.
team.member.michiel.famousLookalike=Ed Norton (though I’m nowhere near that buff!)
team.member.michiel.famousLookToSteal=Aurelio Zen from the hyper stylized BBC series where a bunch of Brits believably look like very slick Italians.
team.member.michiel.howEndedUpHere=Having been part of the ecommerce 1.0 revolution with its excitement and severe limitations, I’ve been relentlessly studying the social shopping phenomenon in all its aspects to look for the next big thing. And this is it – believe me.

team.member.nic.famousLookalike=Dr Tobias Fünke
team.member.nic.famousLookToSteal=Serge Gainsbourg in his early days.
team.member.nic.howEndedUpHere=Writing software from scratch has always been the holy grail for a developer. After a dozen boring job interviews, I got in contact with Michiel who explained the Carmine concept to me. I kind of liked the idea of working in the beauty industry (don’t get me wrong, I was working for a used car website previously), but also jumped on the opportunity to finally create something from the very beginning.

team.member.olivier.bestFeature=Me in my new Filippa-K suit.
team.member.olivier.weirdBeautyExperience=When I was in high school I got sun burnt on my shoulders during a holiday. I didn't have anything put on my skin to cool it - but I remembered having seen cucumber used in different products. Therefore, I figured I would put some cucumber sliced on my shoulders. :-) Great fun, of course.
team.member.olivier.productDyingToTry=A complete spa package in the Maldives.
team.member.olivier.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Love.
team.member.olivier.famousLookalike=Football player Ruud van Nistelrooy and Elvis.
team.member.olivier.famousLookToSteal=George Clooney in one of the Omega watch ads.
team.member.olivier.howEndedUpHere=After having been a tech VC, I moved to the other side of the table to start my own company. While reviewing a number of interesting businesses ideas I could launch, the opportunity came to join the team. Having a strong interest in ecommerce and similar business models, I felt that this was an opportunity I didn't want to miss - so I jumped on the Carmine bandwagon.

team.member.roxanne.fullName=Roxanne Varza
team.member.roxanne.title=Content Director
team.member.roxanne.twitter=@roxannevarza
team.member.roxanne.lastBeautyProductPurchased=Nude nail polish by OPI.
team.member.roxanne.bestFeature=My teeth. I had braces and lots of teeth pulled but it was worth it! Even if I'm a slave to coffee, I avoid drinking carbonated drinks and sodas to protect my pearly whites.
team.member.roxanne.weirdBeautyExperience=My friends convinced me to try putting mayonnaise in my hair once for frizz control. Needless to say it didn't smell that great and was incredibly difficult to get out!
team.member.roxanne.productDyingToTry=That silly fish pedicure...but it freaks me out too much.
team.member.roxanne.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Share.
team.member.roxanne.famousLookalike=Katie Holmes and...CHER (ahhhh!)
team.member.roxanne.famousLookToSteal=Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, beehive included
team.member.roxanne.howEndedUpHere=I love writing and entrepreneurship. A bit of an accidental journalist, I previously managed the French edition of TechCrunch writing about tech startups. Now I get to write about things that are much more glamorous than coding in a garage (although that is pretty glamorous in its own way) and somewhat live the entrepreneurial dream rather than just write about it. I'm also a bit of a social media junkie.

team.member.sarah.bestFeature=Sounds strange but I quite like my ears... They're nice and small :)
team.member.sarah.weirdBeautyExperience=I had to wash my hair with washing up liquid for seven days to strip the colour out of it. The hairdresser recommended it...and it actually worked!

I've just graduated uni and was looking for a job in PR and Marketing and a friend of mine (Emma) had just got an internship at Carmine and let me know about another vacancy. Loved the idea of the company, so I came in and met with Anais and Roxanne and boom! Sorted. :)

I'am passionate about the beauty industry, and I love to discover new products.
team.member.daphnec.bestFeature=My blue/ green eyes because a can easily find a suitable make-up 
team.member.daphnec.weirdBeautyExperience=I served as a model during a trade fair specialized in beauty/ hair dressing two years ago, and the hairdresser cut 20 cm in one time! The haircut was very nice but I was choked to see my hair so short.
team.member.daphnec.productDyingToTry=I would like to try false nails to see the effect. 
team.member.daphnec.beautifulThingSomeoneCanDo=Makes it more beautiful by a hair makeover.

team.member.ben.lastBeautyProductPurchased=David Beckham Homme. I'm not one to buy a Golden Balls product as I feel it's just something cheap and cheerful that he's put his name to, but this stuff smells great and I needed a break from my ever present Issey Miyaki L'Eau D'issey Por Homme.
team.member.ben.bestFeature=
team.member.ben.weirdBeautyExperience=Not weirdest, more like stupidest! Accidentally shaving off my eyebrows on the eve of an important meeting when I was senior designer with Playboy! Got some strange looks from Christie Hefner and her entourage I can tell you!

team.member.ben.howEndedUpHere=I'm an ambitious chap. I became aware that Carmine was looking for a Head of Design & UX to help drive its creative online presence and user experience. After hearing the team's ideas and plan to change the way women interact with one another to find new and exciting products, I was hooked. There is a lot of excitement around the place and I was really keen to get my teeth in to a project from the very beginning and help it grow in to something really awesome.
