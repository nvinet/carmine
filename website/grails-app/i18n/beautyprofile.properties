beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnEdgy.title=Full On Edgy
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnEdgy.paragraph1=An artist at heart, you are your own canvas. Make-up is not necessarily about looking \
your prettiest; it’s about expressing yourself. A constant work in progress, your \
look is always evolving, which is why you’re no stranger to fried hair and own more \
half-used shades than you know what to do with.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnEdgy.paragraph2=Easily bored, you’re always looking for inspiration, whether it’s the runway, indie \
films or a vintage album cover. Your friends think you’re trendy but you actually \
only like a look before it’s in fashion—once you see it everywhere, you’ve already \
moved on to a new vibe.

look is always evolving, which is why you’re no stranger to fried hair and own more \
half-used shades than you know what to do with.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.edgyClassic.paragraph2=You adore mixing styles, like throwing off a sweet vintage dress with messy hair and \
a rocked-out smoky eye. Even if you can spend hours getting your hair and make-up \
just right, you love looking undone. In fact, perfection makes you suspicious: \
smudged eyeliner, dark roots or chipped nail varnish are much more interesting \
than, say, salon-beautiful hair.

beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnClassic.title=Full On Classic
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnClassic.paragraph1=A true sophisticate, your look is chic and polished—never overdone. You know \
exactly what looks good on you and focus on perfecting your signature style rather \
than reinventing your look.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnClassic.paragraph2=You’re puzzled as to why you should wear purple eye shadow just because it was \
on a runway and are more inspired by timeless beauties like Grace Kelly or Nathalie \
Portman. Whether you wear your hair in a sleek ponytail, a pin-straight bob or an \
elegant updo, you always look neat and pulled-together.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnClassic.paragraph3=On a bad day, a fresh manicure (chipped polish drives you mad!) or a blow-dryer can \
make all the difference. You’re disciplined in your beauty routine and once you’ve \
found your perfect scent or shade of red, you’ll stay loyal for life.

beautyProfile.styleProfile.classicEdgy.paragraph4=Classic doesn’t have to mean conservative. You love an off-beat retro look, whether \
it’s a Betty Page fringe or an 80s rock and roll smoky eye.

like Liz Taylor, Marlene Dietrich or Lauren Bacall.

feel perfectly pretty.

beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnGlam.title=Simply Glam
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnGlam.paragraph1=Beauty products are your toys. From carefully cleansing, toning and moisturising to \
applying the third coat of mascara, you adore the ritual of making yourself look \
beautiful every step of the way.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnGlam.paragraph2=You consider sidewalks and hallways naturally occurring runways and if you were a \
celebrity, the paps would never catch you slinking out of Starbucks bare-faced with \
your hair in a scrunchy. Whether you’re headed to the supermarket or a black-tie \
party, your style mantra is bombshell. Wash-and-go hair is not your thing—even if \
you have to get up before everyone else, you love having the power to transform the \
way you look.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnGlam.paragraph3=You’re obsessed with the red carpet and will make any look your own as long as it’s \
feminine. Sexy, high-volume hair; long, perfectly painted nails and killer eye make-up \
make you feel like a million bucks—which is good, cause you’ll spend your last \
penny at the beauty counter OR at Space NK.

colour or a funky haircut, you know how to keep your look fresh.

beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnNatural.title=Full On Natural
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnNatural.paragraph1=You feel prettiest when you look like yourself—on a great day. You don’t always \
wear make-up (foundation kind of freaks you out) and when you do, you use a light \
hand. Heavy eye shadow and bright lipstick make you feel painted—you’d rather \
look fresh and well rested with a dab of concealer and a hint of blusher.
beautyProfile.styleProfile.fullOnNatural.paragraph2=You prefer organic products and when you buy a moisturizer, you go for one with \
ingredients you can pronounce. You like taking care of yourself and will splurge on \
products that give you soft skin, healthy hair and a glowing complexion and you’re \
the only woman you know who can actually fit all her make-up in her bag.
