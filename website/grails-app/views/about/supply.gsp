				<h3>PRODUCT DEPICTION <hr/></h3>
				<p>We have taken reasonable steps to depict products as accurately as possible through the photographs and other images featured on our site. However, please be aware that our site can be viewed on many different devices, and, due to differences in the way they are set up, the photographs and images may not exactly reflect the actual detailing of a product when you receive it.</p>
				<p>If you are not happy with a product when you receive it, please contact us and let us know.</p>

				<p>You will be responsible for the safe keeping of products received from us once they have been delivered to you.</p>
				<h3>DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS <hr/></h3>
				<p>We always aim to ensure our products are of satisfactory quality, though by their nature, some of our items are delicate. If you believe a product was delivered damaged or defective, please inform us as soon as possible in writing, giving us your name, address and order reference. We will offer an exchange in accordance with your legal rights where a product you ordered is damaged or defective when delivered to you. Nothing in this section affects your legal rights.</p>

				<p>If you cancel, you must return the goods to us at your own expense to our distribution centre at Building 4 Eaton Complex, Gatehouse Close, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, HP19 8DE.. You are responsible for the risk of loss or damage when you return goods, so you should take out enough postal insurance to cover their value. </p>
